AndroidDemo Project:
This is a simple android application I've made to demonstrate my skill in the android platform.
At the moment it's only 50% completed, but I'm looking to complete it over the university holidays.
This projet was not part of any University assignment.

Functionality:
The functionality of the app so far is to be able to take photos(using a custom preview) and save them with a description which can be viewed later. 
Eventually I'm hoping to add gyroscope functionality to check the orientation of the phone before taking the photo.
I'll eventually be adding a way to export the photos.

How to Run:
This project was created in android studio and because of this the easiest way to run the program is to simply import the file from github and import using the android gradle settings. 
This should allow you to run the app. I want to note that at present the app only functions properly when using a android phone and not using the virtual machine. I suspect it's something
to do with it not like the x86 version of android but can't confirm at the moment.
